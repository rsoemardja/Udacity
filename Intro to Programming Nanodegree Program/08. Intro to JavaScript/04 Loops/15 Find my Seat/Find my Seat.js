/*
 * Programming Quiz: Find my Seat (4-8)
 *
 * Write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.
 * The first row-seat combination should be 0-0
 * The last row-seat combination will be 25-99
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - the row and seat numbers start at 0, not 1
 *  - the highest seat number is 99, not 100
 */

/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should use a nested `for` loop'
 * - Your code should produce the expected output, as explained above
 */

// Write your code here

var row = 0;  // initial value of the row
var seat = 0; // initial value of the seat within a row

// One loop inside another is called Nested loop.
// Outer `for` loop, to iterate over the rows
for (row = 0; row <= 25; row++) {

    // Inner `for` loop, to iterate over the seats within a row
    // In this loop, the value of `row` variable would change only after 100 iterations
    for (seat = 0; seat <= 99; seat++) {
        console.log(row + "-" + seat);
    }
